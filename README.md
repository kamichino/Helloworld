I've been working in product for about a decade now. Most of my experience has been in e-commerce and retail, but I also have some blockchain experience. 
I'm passionate about creating long-term value for the customer, especially in the EdTech space. During my last project, I developed an online classroom environment for a media company, which we then used to sell video learning experiences (mostly workshops) to enterprise customers. 
I know that your company is developing similar online learning products, and I'd like to work with you on them I have seen many dapp building projects lately, I love this technology! especially farming features. I will take time to learn! Thank you everyone! @kamichino
